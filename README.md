# About rs-paint
I've used MS Paint since I could use a computer. Pixel art, quick edits, painting, note-taking, diagram drawing, wireframing, if it can be done in Paint by god I've probably done it. 

That said, I have a few gripes with it and other Paint-style clones haven't really vibed with me (Paint.net is good, but needlessly complex, gimp is...gimp, etc...)

I want to build my own Paint that is specifically made how I want it. All the good stuff of MS Paint, and maybe some select new features (a simple layer system, maybe?)

Oh also I want to get better at Rust. Hence, RS Paint.

This is mainly a personal project but I'm open to suggestions should any arise. I'll mostly just be working on it in my free time inbetween school and work.
